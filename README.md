# Welcome to the Botitoo Repo! ðŸ¤–
Botitoo is a [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot intended for use in the [Chezito's Cavern](https://discord.gg/chez) Discord server.

## Notice
Note that this bot is currently programmed to work only in the Chezito's Cavern Discord server and will only work with a specific database. This repo is purely made for people belonging to the Discord server who are curious and want to help out in development and maybe make some fixes and/or feature requests! This repo is also made just to make Chez's GitHub profile less of a lifeless wasteland lol.

## Features
### Commands:
- `/ping` - Simple ping command that is purely for testing whether or not the bot is working, and not the actual ping of the bot lol
- `/gif (name)` - List of favorite GIFs picked out by the community and moderators for the bot to send (because people can't just send the GIFs themselve I guess, don't ask Chez why they wanted this command added, cause he doesn't know)
- `/start` - Administrator only command to reset all the user's Media Share limits and open the #submissions channel up to new submissions
- `/count` - Only for people who have access to the special counting channel to see what the current count is
